                You know today I explain myself<br>
Like every girl think 👩🏼<br>
That my prince charm is like that <br>
And looks like this ...👑<br>
And on that time I don't know<br>
 what love is?<br>
Even at my age of 11 class ...📚<br>
You laugh but I don't know<br>
What sex is ?<br>
Where the baby comes ?<br>
Why people gets married ?<br>
But till my wedding I know little bit <br>
After that I know<br>
What love is ...💕<br>
And in my dictionary<br>
Love is a like ticling <br>
in my stomach and heart ❤️<br>
In my life you are as <br>
A Prince charming 🤴🏻<br>
I saw couples all around<br> 
I felt so lonely<br>
But I prayed for halal one<br> 
It's YOU😘<br>
Every wheather<br> 
Every minute<br>
Every second <br>
Every season<br>
Every situation<br>
Iam always stand beside <br>
Holding your hand <br>
And say iam with u😍 <br>
For ever moment<br>
I saw you <br>
My heart-beat stoped ⌚<br>
Before wedding I am nurvous<br>
Always think that<br>
If you change your behaviour<br>
What should I do<br>
But I trust Allah <br>
And I want <br>
Perfect one 😘<br>
I was waiting for the nikah <br>
The moment Allah made us ONE<br>
Now we are<br>
ONE soul<br>
May Allah bless u with happiness<br>
Who give so much love and<br>
Care like princess deserve👸🏻<br>
I feel like so protective<br>
When u r with me👩‍❤️‍👨<br>
Happy birthday🎂🎂<br>
MY PUCCHUUU<br>
Without you <br>
I am nothing❤️<br>
And <br>
I can't live without you 😘<br>
